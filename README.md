# Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning and Neural Networks

This repository contains implementations of some machine learning and neural network models for detecting anomalies in time series data. 

Each model is applied to a dataset to classify anomalies into categories like **Point**, **Contextual**, and **Collective** anomalies, with visualizations and performance metrics provided for analysis.
